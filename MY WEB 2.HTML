           <center> <p><b>WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING ?</b><br>Global Warming is a recent unusual increase in the mean temperature
                of the earth's surface.</p></center>
            
            <center><p>The concentration of greenhouse gases is the main reason for the high increase 
                in world temperatures.
                Greenhouse gases or effects are an increase in the ammount of COâ‚‚ and other gases in 
                the atmosphere which are believed to cause the gradual warming of the earth's surface.</p></center>
            <center><p><b>HOW IS GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTING PEOPLE?</b></p></center>
        <center><p>Global warming is continuously affecting people round the globe in many different ways</p></center>
            <p>1.Floods are one of the negative effects of global warming.
                High temperatures are constantly melting ice on high mountains and in the polar regions thereby
                increasing water levels and thus occurence of Floods</p>
            <p>2.Water scarcity is increasing in dry regions because of the reduction of rainfall
                in arid regions,thus the ammount of water in lakes and rivers reduce leading to water scarcity.</p>
            <P></P>
